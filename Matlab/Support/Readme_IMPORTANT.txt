The files in this directory provide methods managed 
in classes to control measurement devices in the lab.

Most of these files are saved in binary format (p-files).

ATTENTION: You will have to extend the Matlab path to 
the top folder holding these files to use these classes.

ACTIONS:
  - save the files in a dir (e.g. with name 'Support_Files')
  - type 'pathtool' in Matlab
  - add your folder 'Support_Files' (without subfolders!)
  - press save or close button and exit pathtool
  ==> Matlab will find these files now
